	  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Technical Challenges: We did not encounter many technical challenges this week. We are still trying to figure out the details of our project. We have begun using CAD application to model our project but there is a slight learning curve that we need to address.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Scheduling Challenges: A majority of our scheduling issues with other classwork has died down to a reasonable amount. Our biggest challenge now is finding times when we are all availible to meet up and work on the project. The actual hardware building task is something we all need to be present for.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Interpersonal Challenges: No interpersonal challenges this week. Our team has good chemistry and works efficiently together. We still have scheduling issues that we are attempting to solve. Senior year lack of motivation is something to be aware of too in the coming semester.</p>

	  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Technical Challenges: We have had no major technical issues recently. We are hoping to set up a branching system soon which will make our work much more organized. It will also allow us to revert back to previous versions if a mistake is ever made.</p>

	  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Technical Challenges: A challenge we encountered this week was setting up our repository for our ISP. We initially did not have access to editing the repository. This stagnated our progress breifly, but we were able to get back on track. We now have the ability to public publish our concerns and needs for the project through the Issues application of Github.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Scheduling Challenges: A major scheduling challenge we will be facing is finding time to work on our ISP project. In the next couple weeks, all of our team members will be extremely busy with research papers and essays. While we would like to work on the project, we need to prioritize the more serious and upcoming issue at hand before even thinking about the ISP.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Interpersonal Challenges: An interpersonal challenge we faced this week was that not all of our team members were able to be present. Due to sickness, our team was broken up and we were unable to communicate efficiently. Our work was also not evenly distributed as we were required to split the work among two rather than three. Hopefully our team will have more time to work together next week.</p>

	  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Technical Challenges: So far we have not experienced any technical challenges for our ISP project. However, this can be attributed to a lack of focus on the project as we just had finals. Not much progress has been made. We were successfully able to create a Gantt chart using "Click Up" and have used it for chatting about the project. We have done a bit of research regarding the sensors and their possible relationship with motors. We plan on finalizing our plan in the next week or so and move on from there.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Scheduling Challenges: Our main scheduling so far has been staying on track with our Gantt chart. We have neglected our ISP as we have been recently swamped with finals and now multiple important assessments for the International Baccalaureate program. We have been more free-flowing than we would like and need to adhere to our schedule more. To fix this we plan to make meeting dates where we meet either in-person or online to work on the project and hold each other accountable.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Interpersonal Challenges: We have not had any major issues among team members so far. As said before, we have all been equally bad at neglecting our ISP and prioritizing other class work. This is largely due to the urgency of our International Baccalaureate assessments and the long time between now and the due date for the ISP. This may cause issues later on where the work load may be majorly burdened on one individual, thus we must confront this issue now with the team meetings talked about in the "Scheduling Challenges".</p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">(Software) Development Engineer: The role of the "Development Engineer" is designing, creating and testing new products for the companies. Like problem-solvers, they work out why something does not work, and then make it work again. They also make sure that the code is efficient, stable, and works as intended. They also have the job of making sure that the system is secure and can't be back doored. I would be suitible for this role as I have become fairly proficient at coding. Problem-solving is also one of my strengths and would be greatly beneficial.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">QA Engineer: Tests the products to find any bugs or errors in the product. Ensures that the product is good for the customer and to make sure that the specifications are adhered to by the product. I believe that I would not be the best person suitible for this as my house is in a very dark area. My house is block by two two-story houses and does not get much sunlight.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Project Manager: The project manager oversees the whole project, makes a time table and makes sure everyone is on track, meeting the proper deadlines. The project manager also monitors the group, solves any issues that arise, evaluates project performance and leads the team. I think that I would be suitible for this role as I take initiative and have leadership skills. I am able to be respectful to others but be direct when need be.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Product Manager: Oversees product development and building. Balances time and other constraints with feature set, and provides support to ensure that all other members are meeting requirements. Manages interactions between different components of the product, e.g. UI/UX, QA, and Development. I think I would be suitible for this role as I understand the demands of the project as well as the demands that my teammates face with schoolwork.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Release Engineer: The role of a "Release Engineer" is to control and manage the GitHub repository of the group. A Release Engineer must communicate with managers. This is to report of any updates that should be pulled before editing. I would be suitible for this role as I have experience from last year being a Release Manager for my scheduling application team.</p>
