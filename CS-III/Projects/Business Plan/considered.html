	<h2 id="Option1" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option1</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/berkley-voss/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Initially, I found the concept of the game intriguing. A platformer game is a good introduction to the world of video game development. The project would not take too long to make or be too difficult. However, I believe that the project does not have a real-world problem in mind and is not something I hope to pursue in the future.</p>
	      
	<h2 id="Option2" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option2</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">I think that the idea of a card that could pull up specific information interesting. It would be a useful piece of technology. The idea reminded me of a project some of my friends did last year with an RFID card reader. However, this project hopes to use a phone to detect the contents of a card and I can only see this being done through the camera. This would not solve any problem as we have QR codes.</p>
	      
	      <h2 id="Option3" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option3</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-liu/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This project was another interesting game project proposal. While the business plan did not mention what the game would necessarily be, it highlighted monetization through ads and “battle pass”. This did not appeal to me though as advertisements have to be contracted. These advertisements would also not be for reputable companies and would most likely try to take advantage of the user. Ethically, I am unable to do this.</p>
	      
	      <h2 id="Option4" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option4</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/farhan-ishraque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This project proposal is actually something I have been interested in for a long time. I have always wanted to build a computer. This project would create the opportunity for me to do this. However, the creation of a website to sell these projects is not something new to what I have already been doing. I would hope to expand my knowledge during this project.</p>
	      
	      <h2 id="Option5" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option5</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/david-ortega/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">The project proposal brings up a current pressing issue of mental health. A plan is presented to identify mental health issues and an attempt at treatment. However, there are some ethical considerations that need to be made aware of. For example, the medical advice of a website created by a high schooler may influence the mental health of a user. Also, considerable research would need to be done in the field of psychology; this project does not seem feasible.</p>
	      
	      <h2 id="Option6" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option6</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-ye/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This project proposal has highlighted an issue, that if solved, would be beneficial to the study of computer science entirely. The translation of languages would allow for code to be easily copied and considerable time to be saved. However, I believe that the task is far beyond the knowledge we currently have. I believe that this project may be doomed to fail from the very beginning. Translating coding languages is not as simple as translating languages normally. It would also require an extremely high understanding of the presented languages.</p>
	      
	      <h2 id="Option7" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option7</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/joshua-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">The issue highlighted by the business plan is very relevant. The automation of a population’s attendance would greatly decrease wasted time in many situations. However, I feel that the applications of this idea may be limited by the need to have the facial recognition program recognize such a large number of individuals. With the technology we students have on hand I do not think this would be possible.</p>
	      
	      <h2 id="Option8" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option8</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/khoi-pham/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">The project proposed seems like a very fun idea. Customizable rollerblades that can change color based on the wants of the user would be fun to make and could incorporate computer science through the use of an app to control the lights. However, I feel that this project does not have a problem it is attempting to solve.</p>
	      
	      <h2 id="Option9" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Option9</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kyle-hernandez/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Like the other video game projects proposed, I found the idea very interesting. The business plan brought back nostalgic memories from when I would play video games such as the mentioned Sonic. But again I feel that the creation of a video game would not be as challenging as I would like nor solve a real-world problem.</p>
	      
	      <h2 id="Chosen" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Chosen</h2>
	      <a style="color: white; margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/heng-yi-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
	      <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This ISP proposal was another I found interesting. The world of automated appliances has already begun to change our households to have more technology incorporated into them. The use of a weather API and the hardware required for the project makes a good balance between computer science and engineering. The problem this project is attempting to solve is climate change by reducing the need for powerful temperature-controlling devices; this resonates with my own core beliefs as a problem I wish to solve.</p>
