      <div class="row">

	  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Artificial intelligence has been a wonder to man that has alluded us for years. We as a society have worked to try and implement artificial intelligence into all the products we use daily such as: phones, TV remotes, and even speakers. Unfortunatly for us we do not have the capabilities of a "Tony Stark" to build an artificial intelligence that we can use reliably. Researches have created programs that can learn from past experiences which we call "machine learning" (Oxford Languages, n.d.). These programs are the beginning of how we make artificial intelligence more advanced than it has ever been.</p>
	</div>
	<h2 id="cybersecurity" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">How is Artificial Intelligence Beneficial?</h2>
	<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Artificial intelligence has many benefits that it can bring to society. One point to highlight is that computers can have an infinite larger knowledge on a subject than a human ever can as they have free access to the internet. This gives artificial intelligence speed and accuracy which is unmatched. Humans can be limited by a multitude of factors, however, a computer is only limited by its hardware. Artificial intelligence can be used by business to analyse vasts amounts of data (ITU., n.d.). Often data points can not always be monitored and interpreted by humans. But computers can! These can have benefits that improve the standard of living for humans such as health vulnerabilites and insurance risks. We can actually see some instances of artificial intelligence improving our lives right now. Tesla, an electric car company, implements artificial intelligence in the programming for their cars for many reasons. These include functions such as auto parking, obstacle detection, and self-driving (Built In., n.d.).</p>
	<h2 id="future" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">How is Artificial Intelligence Bad?</h2>
	<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Artificial intelligence raises many concerns. Some ask the question "What if the computers turn on us?" Like the movie "The Terminator" the fear of a computer uprising is very real. Our society runs on computers and without them we would be in chaos. A large eye is turned on nuclear weapon systems. Nuclear weapons and nuclear warfare has been a major issue since the Cold War where the United States and the Soviet Union threatened the first nuclear war. Artificial intelligence runs the risk of these systems being overrun and a missile being launch, thus resulting in a nuclear war. Right now artificial intelligence has a limited amount of applications it can be applied to. They can often only be applicible to the functions they are designed for and not generalizable to other tasks. Artificial intelligence may be dominant to humans in speed and accuracy, but human triumph when it comes to problem-solving and adaptablility (University of Cambridge, n.d.). It is also interesting to think about the economic effects artificial intelligence may have. Many with lose their jobs to the first commercially available artificial intelligence systems. Secretaries will lose their jobs to robot answering machines. This is almost seen in "The Office" where Pam is almost replaced by said system. All jokes aside artificial intelligence does play a threat to jobs that humans currently hold. We can see examples that differ greatly. Stores have already implemented robot servers and kiosks that remove the need for an employee. And even doctors are at risk as we see robots performing complex surgeries (ITU, n.d.). In conclusion, artificial intelligence holds many benefits that can aid humanity, but we must also account for the many risks that it may incur.</p>
	<h2 id="ethics" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Ethics of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
	<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">There are many questions that need to be answered when working with AI. One is the purpose behind the technology. Using AI for malicious intent can have negative consequences on society. The idea of autonomous weapons is a frightening thought that could potentially become very real. Weapons that can fire on their own without an operator could be a great assest in war, however, in the wrong hands it could make every day life a nightmare (Rohde et al, 2021). Another concern of AI is how it reaches its goals. Ethics vary between region. What may be seen as morally O.K. somewhere may be taboo somewhere else. It is very difficult for AI to meet the ethics of everyone, so which should it choose? If an AI machine is able to perform a task that brings positive benefits but at the cost of destruction, should it do it? These questions are necessary when constructing AI as after AI is used, backlash will be received. AI has the potential to be more inteligent than humans. This raises the concern of whether AI will rise against us and will its ethics supercede our own (Rohde et al, 2021).</p>
	<h2 id="ToUse" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">To Use AI Or Not To Use AI, That Is The Question</h2>
	<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Artificial intelligence is a great assest to mankind that we have no idea the benefits that co-exist with it. As we continue to develop AI we must understand the many risks that come along. While we may be the more intelligent and resourceful of the the two, there is no guarantee that that social hierarcy will continue to be that way. In order for artifcial intelligence to be properly implemented into society, we need to weigh the benefits and negatives that may arise. Will AI may be able to improve the standard of living for the majority of society, the lower class will be greatly affected as they lose job opportunities. The growing risk of weaponized AI threathens society and the common man as we become less and less in control of our safety. As we become reliant on other means of protects the dependency on AI grows (Harvard Business Review, 2021). Finally, the ethics of AI production must be accounted for to ensure that AI is properly used and maintained. In conclusion, AI is beneficial to society, but in its current state it is not ready for mainstream use.</p>
