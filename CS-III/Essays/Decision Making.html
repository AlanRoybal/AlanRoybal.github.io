	<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Decision making biases are a common phenomenon in which individuals make irrational or illogical choices based on certain cognitive biases. These biases can affect the quality of decision making and lead to poor outcomes. Here are five common decision making biases:</p>
	</div>
	<h2 id="confirmationbias" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Confirmation Bias</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out information that supports our existing beliefs and to ignore or discount information that contradicts those beliefs. This bias can lead to a lack of objectivity and an inability to consider alternative perspectives(Healy). This bias could influence our ISP group as we become so engrossed in a specific way to create our product that we neglect any other outside suggestion. Especially working in a group, it is important for us to be aware of how our own opinions and egos may influence our judgement. To overcome this we will use the many lessons we have gotten from our Theory of Knowledge class. Our experiences involving IAs and the EE will be enough for us to mitigate the effects of confirmation bias.</p>
	<h2 id="anchoringbias" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Anchoring Bias</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Anchoring bias is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making a decision. This can lead to a lack of flexibility and an inability to adapt to new information(“Bias: Anchoring Bias”). Our endeavors in creating our automated window shade may not be the best version possible due to anchoring bias. By not aknowledging other ideas and proposed methods of overcoming obstacles, we may stagnate our progress in the future. To overcome this obstacle we can hold checkpoints and research meetings throughout our developing process so that we have multiple references of "initial" data.</p>
  <h2 id="groupthink" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Groupthink</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Groupthink is the phenomenon in which individuals within a group tend to conform to the dominant opinion of the group, even if that opinion is not supported by facts or evidence. This can lead to poor decision making and a lack of critical thinking within the group(Kenton). Our group may be victim to groupthink as we are all close friends. We may not want to hurt or offend each other and thus we do not want to say how we disapprove of an idea. However, I believe our group will not have to worry about this bias to greatly as we have learned how to overcome this problem in our other IB classes.</p>
  <h2 id="lossaversion" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Loss Aversion</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Loss aversion is the tendency to avoid taking risks and to prioritize avoiding losses over making gains. This can lead to a lack of innovation and a reluctance to pursue new opportunities(“Loss Aversion”). Being overwhelmed with work and "senioritis", we may not want to attempt any new risks in fear of creating more work for ourselves or going backwards in progress. This will most likely be one of our greatest obstacles to overcome as we near toward the end of the year and graduation. The main way we can avoid this bias is through keeping each other accountable. None of us want to shoulder more of a burden than we already have, thus we will keep each other accountable for our work.</p>
  <h2 id="overconfidence" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Overconfidence Bias</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Overconfidence bias is the tendency to overestimate our own abilities and to underestimate the risks associated with a decision. This can lead to poor decision making and a lack of humility(“Overconfidence Bias”). Being seniors and Computer Science 3 students, we may overestimate our developing abilities. This may result in us procrastinating a large part of our work. Such procrastination could result in a lackluster product or none at all depending on how quickly we are to become aware of this decision bias. A way we can not fall trap to this bias is by adhering strictly to our Gantt chart so we never fall behind.</p>
  <h2 id="conclusion" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Conclusion</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Overall, these decision making biases can have negative consequences for individuals and organizations. It is important to be aware of these biases and to actively work to overcome them in order to make better, more rational decisions.</p>
