      <p class="phome" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%"> Hello, and welcome to my digital portfolio! Here you'll learn a bit about me and what makes me so great (but that should be obvious). This digital portfolio is important to me as it shows my growth and progression the past few years as I went from a novice computer science student to an individual with their foot in the game.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="phome" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Last year in computer science I learned a lot about how act like a person in the workplace environment. With our sudoku project, I learned how to work together as a team to meet our goals. With our schedule app project, I learned the struggle of putting a team on my back but some necessary skills such as CSS and HTML. And finally I had our ISP project where I learned how to mix my coding projects with actual hardware (which can be seen in the ISP tab).</p>

	  <p class="aboutme" style="margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 10%">Hi! My name is Alan Roybal but you may know me as Mr. Ben's favorite. I was born January 30, 2005 in Los Angeles California. I've lived the majority of my life in Allen, Texas and attend Allen High School currently. I am part of the International Baccalaureate program, a computer science 3 student, and a swim captain. Some of my hobbies are videogames, going to the gym, playing piano, and hanging out with friends.</p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <p class="aboutme" style="margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 10%">I've always been interested in computers since I was a little kid. My most favorite and most used Christmas gift has been my laptop. I use it every day for homework and just messing around. I have a good foundation for computer science as I started at a very early age. In elementary school I enrolled in JavaScript classes utilizing Alice and Eclipse IDE at the University of Texas at Dallas. Currently, I am a student in my third year of advanced computer science.</p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <p class="aboutme" style="margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 10%">So far in my computer sciences classes I have been a leader and pioneer. In a project to design a scheduling application for the school and its students, I took upon the leadership role of release manager. During this time I was in charge of the branches and releases we put out. In the classroom I am actively engaged by answering questions and helping my peers whenever possible. My cooperation skills make me both reliable and fluent in the team setting.</p>

	  <p>Concept - We implemented the Google Assistant API technology that smart mirrors utilize into an infinity mirror.</p>
	  <p>Motivation - To make something cool and practical in everyday life.</p>
	  <p>Conclusion - We never expected how difficult it would be having to change our plan when an unexpected challenge arised such as the lights we needed being out of stock.</p>
	  <p> Explantion - The code segment to the left shows how our Google API functioned once an activation phrase was spoken. The Google Assistant would then say that it is listening and wait until a response was spoken or timer shuts off the assistant. Google would then complete the request if given one and then shut down.</p>

	<div class="column" style="background-color:#193634;">
	  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">As technology has grown to become more advanced the need for security has equally grown. The internet has become so readily available as it has been introduced into our homes and has become integrated into our lives. However, this means that those who wish to misuse the internet equally have access to it. The average person can be easily preyed upon by those with malicious intents and thus the responsibility of keeping the internet safe falls on us with knowledge.</p>

	<h2 id="cybersecurity" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Cyber Security</h2>
	<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Encryption of data alluded the internet with the original HTTP web connection. Websites could be impersonated and while this wasn't a problem at the start of the internet, as businesses began creating online platforms, personal information such as social security numbers and checking accounts were being put in harms way. The encrypted version - HTTPS - was then created. While it was expensive and difficult to maintain and run a web server it was a more secure option. HTTPS used a secure connection known as either SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). In the current day technology has advanced to the point that HTTPS web connections can be maintained at all times. The primary purposes of this connection is to encrypt user data and to authenticate connection between user and website. However, the use of HTTPS Proxy Appliances has made it so that the encryption of HTTPS can be bypassed. This is done by using a third-party application that intercepts the encrypted traffic before passing it to the intended destination (Gibson, 2020). This "Man In The Middle" (MITM) can be dangerous as a user can be completely unaware of the interception (College Languages, 2022). Normally the "Certificate Authorities" (CA) passes a users encrypted data after a website has sufficiently proven it's identity (Gibson, 2020). However, the use of "Pseudo Certificate Authorities" can be easily done and grants access to all the users data. While a SSL interception can not be prevented it can be detected and thus a user can avoid a fraudulent web connection (Gibson, 2020). This can be done due to the property that a security certificate can not be perfectly recreated. A security certificate compromises of a complex algoritm known as a hash. Hashes are remarkable as if even one part of the hash is changed, about half of the hash is changed in response. Due to its reliability and security, much of the industry has switched to the "Secure Hashing Algoritm 1" (SHA1) (Gibson, 2020). Often thses big companies such as Google deploy multiple security certificates, however, this can cause problems with security tools such as a false-negative - when a security tool fails to detect a particular threat - and a false positive - when a security tool misdetects a vulnerability as present (National Institute Of Standards And Technology, n.d.).</p>
	<h2 id="future" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">The Future</h2>
	<p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">As we've looked at in the previous paragraph, the use of Pseudo Certificate Authorities has allowed the privacy of an individual to be invaded and monitored, often without the knowledge of the user (Gibson, 2020). This raises the question "Should organizations have the right to eavesdrop on our communications?" Unfortunatly the answer to this question is subjective to whoever you ask. The experiences of a common internet user differs from a professional software engineer. The trauma that a scam victim has indured can influence their opinion more than a child who scrolls through Youtube. Either extreme has large consequences that the majority of people can't live with. There is always one side that loses out. My personal belief is that there should be some monitoring of users by an organization, however to a small degree. Users should be tracked if they can be deemed unsafe to society, but the common man should not suffer for the faults of others.</p>
